ed2k
==================================
This command only prints ed2k links to console and doesn't utilize the anidb API. Links can be added to mylist manually using "ed2k dump" feature on the website.
The only option for this command is:
    * **"--clipboard"**, **"-c"**: Copy ed2k links to clipboard after generating all of them.
